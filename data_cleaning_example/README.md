# Data Preprocessing Project: Retail Sales Optimization

## Scenario

You are a data analyst at a national retail chain that operates physical stores across multiple cities. The company has been collecting transactional and customer-level data to better understand sales performance, customer behavior, and store operations.

However, the dataset contains various data quality issues due to:
- Faulty in-store systems (e.g., missing sensor readings)
- Incomplete data entry by staff
- Migration errors during system upgrades

This dataset includes **missing values**, **outliers**, and **inconsistent data entries**, making it an ideal candidate for a robust preprocessing pipeline.

---

## Project Goal

> Clean and prepare the dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior and sales trends, with the ultimate goal of supporting personalized marketing and inventory optimization strategies.

---

## Key Objectives

- **Handle Missing Values**
  - Identify missing data patterns
  - Apply appropriate imputation or removal strategies

- **Detect and Manage Outliers**
  - Use statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) to flag anomalies
  - Decide whether to drop, cap, or further investigate outliers

- **Normalize and Scale Data**
  - Apply Min-Max Scaling or Standardization to support machine learning models

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Create useful derived features (e.g., sales per item, high-spender flag)

- **Visual Exploration**
  - Use histograms, boxplots, and missing value maps (`missingno`) to understand distributions and data quality issues

## Deliverables

- Cleaned, analysis-ready dataset
- Summary report on cleaning steps and findings
- Visualizations highlighting key trends and challenges
- Optional: scripts or notebooks for reproducibility
