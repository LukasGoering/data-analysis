# Data Analysis

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of practical data analysis scripts written in Python. Each script reflects different stages of a typical data pipeline â€” from webscraping over data cleaning and preprocessing to visualization and web scraping.

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Data wrangling with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Web scraping and API interaction
- Writing modular and readable code for real-world scenarios

In the subfolders, you will find separate readme's for each program.
